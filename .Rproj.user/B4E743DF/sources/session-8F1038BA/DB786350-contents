#Looks good. But I do have a concern. Its hard to know for 
#certain what role age is playing in this data since
#age had to be used as the response variable. I'd be willing
#to bet that had age been apart of the regression we would
#see it contributing a larger hazard rate. Nodes is also pretty 
#close to 1 which is just the null hypothesis with a standard
#error of 0.01. But the model does claim it to be signifigant
#with a concordance of 0.631.
