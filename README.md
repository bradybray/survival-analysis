# Survival Analysis and Statistics
This is a simple set of code I wrote a couple years ago for a job interview with a small biomedical team. The team worked with radiological dosages and wanted to hire another analyst to join their team. In this example I used some statistical methods that would be of interest to them such as using the Coupon Collector problem to analyse the time it takes to collect a full set of items. I also performed some simple multi-variate analysis and survival analysis of medical data.
